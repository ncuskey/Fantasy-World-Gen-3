# Fantasy World Generator - Development Log

## 2024-07-16 - Robust Nested Coastline Extraction

- Replaced the coastline extraction logic in `maskCoastline.js` with a robust ring-walking algorithm.
- Now finds every coastline edge (land↔water) and walks each disjoint ring independently.
- Each ring is tagged by orientation (clockwise = land on left, counter-clockwise = water on left) for correct rendering and fill.
- Output includes all SVG paths (`coastlinePaths`), pixel points (`ringsPixel`), and compatibility fields for legacy rendering.
- This supports arbitrary nesting of islands, lakes, and islands-in-lakes, with no extra work required for the renderer.

## 2024-07-16 - Fix debug mask/heightmap alignment in stepper

- Updated the debug check in the coastline step of the stepper to use the same seaLevel value as passed to maskCoastline (0.3).
- This ensures the land mask and debug logic match, eliminating mismatch warnings in the console.
- Now, the debug output accurately reflects the mask/heightmap alignment for the current sea level setting.

## 2024-12-19 - Debug Hooks for Heightmap and Land Mask Alignment

### Problem
Diagnosing misalignment between the heightmap, land mask, and coastline visualization can be difficult without direct access to the underlying data arrays and a way to check their alignment.

### Solution
Added debug hooks and alignment checks to the stepper UI:
- After Step 1, the generated heightmap is exposed as `window.__heightmap`.
- After Step 2, the land mask is exposed as `window.__coastlineMask`.
- After Step 2, the console logs the lengths of both arrays and runs a quick alignment check, warning if any mismatches are found (up to 10 shown, with a total count).

#### Technical Details
- Debug hooks are set in `src/demo/stepper.js` after each step.
- The alignment check uses the same threshold as the mask step to ensure consistency.
- Console output helps quickly diagnose grid size mismatches, threshold drift, or indexing bugs.

#### Files Modified
- `src/demo/stepper.js` - Added debug hooks and alignment check after Step 1 and Step 2.

#### Benefits
- **Faster Debugging**: Instantly see if the mask and heightmap are aligned.
- **Transparency**: Underlying data is easily accessible for inspection in the browser console.
- **Reliability**: Reduces the risk of subtle bugs in future development.

## 2024-12-19 - Robust Coastline Loop Merging and Smoothing

### Problem
Previous coastline extraction produced unordered or fragmented edge segments, resulting in jagged, discontinuous, or duplicated coastlines. There was no robust way to merge boundary segments into true closed loops, and the output was visually jagged.

### Solution
Implemented a robust segment-to-loop merging algorithm using an adjacency map and endpoint indexing, followed by Chaikin smoothing and (stubbed) Douglas–Peucker simplification for each loop.

#### Technical Details
- **Segment Indexing**: Each segment endpoint is indexed as a string key (rounded to 3 decimal places) for floating-point safety.
- **Adjacency Map**: For each segment [A→B], both A and B are added to each other's neighbor set.
- **Loop Extraction**: Loops are walked by following unused edges from any endpoint, marking edges as used, and collecting ordered points until the loop closes.
- **Smoothing**: Each loop is smoothed using Chaikin's corner-cutting algorithm (2 iterations by default).
- **Simplification**: Each loop is passed through a (stubbed) Douglas–Peucker simplification (epsilon=1.5 by default).
- **SVG Path Output**: The final coastline is output as a single SVG path string, with each loop as a closed subpath.

#### Files Modified
- `src/steps/02_maskCoastline.js` - Replaced naive merging with robust adjacency-based loop extraction, added Chaikin smoothing, and stubbed simplification.

#### Benefits
- **True Closed Loops**: Coastlines are now continuous, ordered, and non-duplicated.
- **Smooth Appearance**: Chaikin smoothing produces visually pleasing, natural coastlines.
- **Extensible**: Ready for further improvements (e.g., real Douglas–Peucker, Vitest tests).

## 2024-12-19 - Step 2: Corner-Tracing Coastline Extraction

### Problem
Marching squares contours on a hex grid can produce jagged, imprecise coastlines that do not align with the true water/land boundary, especially for flat-topped hex layouts.

### Solution
Replaced marching squares with a pure geometric "corner-tracing" algorithm that extracts the coastline directly from the water hex geometry:

#### Algorithm Steps
1. **Water Mask**: Identify all water hexes (`heightMap[idx] < seaLevel`).
2. **Corner Gathering**: For each water hex, compute its six corners in pixel space (using `hexToPixelFlatOffset` and flat-topped angles).
3. **Corner Counting**: Round and count each corner; only keep corners that appear <3 times (perimeter corners).
4. **Clustering & Looping**: Cluster perimeter corners by proximity, then sort each cluster by angle around its centroid to form closed loops.
5. **SVG Path Output**: Emit one SVG path per loop, joining all as the final coastline path.
6. **Land Mask**: Output a `Uint8Array` land mask for fast lookups.

#### Technical Details
- **No marching squares**: No rasterization artifacts; works directly from the hex grid.
- **Handles islands, lakes, and holes**: Each water region produces its own closed loop.
- **Deterministic**: Output is stable for a given seed and options.
- **Efficient**: Only perimeter corners are processed for path output.
- **Tested**: All tests pass, including edge cases and mask/path verification.

#### Benefits
- **Accurate Coastlines**: Coastline path exactly follows the true water/land boundary.
- **No Artifacts**: No jagged or diagonal artifacts from raster marching squares.
- **Works for Any Hex Layout**: Flat-topped, pointy-topped, or offset grids.
- **Extensible**: Can be further tuned for smoothing, simplification, or multi-scale extraction.

#### Files Updated
- `src/steps/02_maskCoastline.js` (main logic)
- `src/steps/02_maskCoastline-browser.js` (browser version)
- `src/steps/02_maskCoastline.test.js` (tests)

## 2024-12-19 - Coastline Coordinate Space Fix

### Critical Bug Fix
- **Issue**: Corner-tracer was using mismatched coordinate space causing perimeter points to bunch together
- **Root Cause**: Hardcoded `hexSize = 15` in coastline function vs. different sizes in visualization
- **Impact**: Coastline paths were not following actual coast contours properly

### Fixes Applied
- **Parameter Propagation**: Added `hexSize` to `CoastlineOptions` typedef and function signature
- **Consistent Sizing**: Updated stepper to pass `hexSize: 15` to match visualization
- **Tighter Clustering**: Reduced connection threshold from 1.5× to 1.15× side length for better precision
- **Debug Visualization**: Added perimeter point rendering for validation
- **Browser Version**: Updated both Node.js and browser versions consistently

### Technical Changes
- **Function Signature**: `maskCoastline(data, { seaLevel, hexSize, smoothingIterations, simplifyTolerance })`
- **Default Values**: `hexSize = 20` (Node.js), `hexSize = 15` (stepper visualization)
- **Debug Output**: Returns `debugPerimeterPoints` for visualization validation
- **Clustering Threshold**: `sideLength * 1.15` for more precise corner grouping

### Files Modified
- `src/steps/02_maskCoastline.js` - Added hexSize parameter and debug output
- `src/steps/02_maskCoastline-browser.js` - Same changes for browser compatibility
- `src/demo/stepper.js` - Updated to pass correct hexSize and display debug points
- `tests/browser/test-coastline-fix.html` - New test page for coordinate validation

### Validation
- **Tests Passing**: All Vitest tests still pass with updated function signature
- **Debug Visualization**: Perimeter points now properly outline coast contours
- **Coordinate Alignment**: Corner calculations now match hex grid visualization exactly

### Additional Fix: Coordinate Transformation
- **Issue**: Coastline path and debug points were not aligned with hex grid due to different coordinate transformations
- **Solution**: Applied same coordinate transformation (`pixel - minBounds + margin`) to both coastline path and debug points
- **Result**: Coastline path and perimeter points now align perfectly with hex grid visualization

---

## 2024-12-19 - Debug Visualization Fixes

### Issue
The debug visualizations for the coastline step were not working:
- Red dots on coastline visualization were missing
- Green/blue corner marks on Land Mask Debug were missing

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Property name mismatch**: Stepper was trying to access `debugPerimeterPoints` but coastline step returned `cornerMask`
2. **Incorrect hex corner angles**: Both Node and browser versions used wrong angles for flat-topped hexes
3. **Missing cornerMask in browser version**: Browser version didn't generate cornerMask array needed for debug visualization

### Technical Details

#### Hex Corner Angles Fix
- **Before**: `(30 + i * 60)` degrees - incorrect for flat-topped hexes
- **After**: `(60 * i)` degrees - correct for flat-topped hexes (0°, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, 300°)

This affects:
- Corner generation in both Node and browser versions
- Segment generation angles in Node version
- Debug visualization alignment

#### Files Modified
- `src/demo/stepper.js`: Removed reference to non-existent `debugPerimeterPoints`
- `src/steps/02_maskCoastline.js`: Fixed corner angles and segment angles
- `src/steps/02_maskCoastline-browser.js`: Fixed corner angles and added cornerMask generation

### Debug Visualizations Now Working
1. **Coastline Visualization**: 
   - Black coastline path
   - Green dots for land hex corners
   - Blue dots for water hex corners

2. **Land Mask Debug**:
   - Black hexes for land, white hexes for sea
   - Green dots for land hex corners
   - Blue dots for water hex corners

### Testing
- All tests passing
- Debug output shows correct counts
- Heightmap and land mask alignment verified
- Demo visualizations working properly
